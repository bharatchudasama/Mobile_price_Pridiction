## Model Training

The following steps are performed during model training:
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracting maximum megapixels from camera specifications.
   - Calculating total screen resolution (pixels).
2. **Scaling**:
   - Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
   - The target variable is scaled for better model performance.
3. **Training**:
   - A machine learning model is trained using `scikit-learn`.
   - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

## Prediction Pipeline

A custom prediction pipeline is implemented to:
1. Take user inputs for mobile specifications.
2. Preprocess the input data (scaling, encoding categorical variables).
3. Predict the scaled price.
4. Inverse-transform the scaled prediction to obtain the actual price.

## Visualization

The project includes visualizations to analyze the data and model performance:
- Distribution of mobile prices.
- Correlation matrix of numerical features.
- Scatter plots showing relationships between features like RAM, Storage, and Price.

## Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use tools like GridSearchCV for optimal model parameters.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implement neural networks for better predictions.
- **Real-Time Prediction App**: Build a web app for users to input specifications and get price predictions.
- **Enhanced Features**: Include additional features like launch year, user reviews, and processor details.
